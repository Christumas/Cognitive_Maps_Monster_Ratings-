Important notes about the code:

You will find a couple of duplicate plugins as follows : ("plugin name - Copy.js")
  I have adjusted the html-keyboard-response plugin (see line 123 - 141) to ensure a green selection border after a keyboard response is provided.
  The free-sort plugin has also been adjusted to ensure the stimuli can be freely moved around the entire screen and not restricted to the height of the <div> of the free sort arena.

All necessary experiment components are stored in the ExperimentClasses.js script.
ExperimentMain.js is the script that controls the entire flow of the experiment.
